    "description": "Implement a function called 'two_sum' that finds two numbers in an array that add up to a target value.\n\n1. Input:\n   - nums: A list of integers\n   - target: The target sum to find\n\n2. Output:\n   - Return a list of two indices [i, j] such that nums[i] + nums[j] = target\n   - You may assume that each input has exactly one solution\n   - You may not use the same element twice\n\n3. Constraints:\n   - 2 <= len(nums) <= 10^4\n   - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n   - -10^9 <= target <= 10^9\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9\nOutput: [0, 1]\nExplanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6\nOutput: [1, 2]\nExplanation: nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [3, 3], target = 6\nOutput: [0, 1]\nExplanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 3 = 6",
    "analysis": "1. Problem requirements and constraints\n   - The function should return two indices from the given array where the corresponding numbers add up to the target value.\n   - Each input is guaranteed to have exactly one solution.\n   - The same element cannot be used twice.\n   - The length of the array is between 2 and 10^4.\n   - The integers in the array and the target are between -10^9 and 10^9.\n\n2. Key components and their relationships\n   - The function needs to traverse the given array and for each number, find if there is another number in the array that when added gives the target sum.\n\n3. Error handling and validation requirements\n   - Required input validation checks: The array should not be empty and should contain at least two elements.\n   - Type checking requirements: The elements in the array and the target should be integers.\n   - Expected exceptions and error conditions: If the array contains less than two elements, an error should be returned. If any element in the array or the target is not an integer, an error should be returned.\n   - Edge cases that must be handled: The edge cases include situations where the two numbers are at the start or at the end of the array, or where the two numbers are the same.\n   - Invalid input scenarios: Any scenario where the array is empty, contains less than two elements, or contains non-integer elements; or where the target is not an integer.\n   - Boundary conditions: The array length is between 2 and 10^4.\n\n4. Implementation considerations\n   - Suggested approach: A possible approach is to use a hash map to store each number and its index when iterating through the array. For each number, we check if (target - number) exists in the hash map. If it does, we return the current index and the index stored in the hash map.\n   - Required error handling: Check for valid input, and handle the error cases and invalid input scenarios as described above.\n   - Input validation strategy: Initially validate the input to ensure it meets the problem constraints.\n   - Type checking approach: Use appropriate built-in functions to check the type of the inputs.\n\n5. Performance requirements\n   - Time complexity constraints: With the suggested approach, the time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.\n   - Space complexity constraints: The space complexity is also O(n) as we store each element in a hash map.\n   - Memory usage considerations: None, as the problem constraints limit the size of the input and thus the memory usage.\n   - Performance optimization opportunities: None, as the suggested approach is already optimal.\n\n6. Testing requirements\n   - Critical test cases: Test with a variety of arrays and targets to ensure the function correctly identifies the two numbers that add up to the target.\n   - Error scenarios to test: Test with invalid inputs to ensure the function handles error conditions correctly.\n   - Edge cases to verify: Test with edge cases such as the two numbers being at the start, in the middle, or at the end of the array, or the two numbers being the same.\n   - Performance benchmarks needed: Test with a large array to verify the function can handle the maximum allowed input size."
