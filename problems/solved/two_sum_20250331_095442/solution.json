    "description": "Implement a function called 'two_sum' that finds two numbers in an array that add up to a target value.\n\n1. Input:\n   - nums: A list of integers\n   - target: The target sum to find\n\n2. Output:\n   - Return a list of two indices [i, j] such that nums[i] + nums[j] = target\n   - You may assume that each input has exactly one solution\n   - You may not use the same element twice\n\n3. Constraints:\n   - 2 <= len(nums) <= 10^4\n   - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n   - -10^9 <= target <= 10^9\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9\nOutput: [0, 1]\nExplanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6\nOutput: [1, 2]\nExplanation: nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [3, 3], target = 6\nOutput: [0, 1]\nExplanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 3 = 6",
    "analysis": "1. Problem requirements and constraints:\n   - The function should find two numbers in a given array that sum up to a given target value.\n   - The function should return the indices of the two numbers.\n   - Each input has exactly one solution.\n   - The same element cannot be used twice.\n   - The numbers in the array and the target can range from -10^9 to 10^9.\n   - The length of the array can range from 2 to 10^4.\n\n2. Key components and their relationships:\n   - The function will iterate over the array to find the two numbers that sum up to the target.\n   - A data structure (like a hash map) can be used to store the difference between the target and the current number in the iteration, and its index.\n\n3. Error handling and validation requirements:\n   - Required input validation checks:\n     - Verify that the input is a list.\n     - Verify that the list has at least two elements.\n     - Verify that the target is an integer.\n   - Type checking requirements:\n     - The elements in the list must be integers.\n   - Expected exceptions and error conditions:\n     - If the input is not a list or the target is not an integer, an exception should be thrown.\n   - Edge cases that must be handled:\n     - If the array has only two elements, return [0, 1] if they sum up to the target, else throw an exception.\n   - Invalid input scenarios:\n     - An array with less than two elements.\n     - A non-integer target.\n   - Boundary conditions:\n     - An array with only two elements.\n     - An array with the maximum allowed number of elements (10^4).\n\n4. Implementation considerations:\n   - Suggested approach:\n     - Use a hash map to store the difference between the target and the current number, and its index.\n     - Check if the current number exists in the hash map, if it does return the indices.\n   - Required error handling:\n     - Handle invalid inputs by throwing exceptions.\n   - Input validation strategy:\n     - Check the types and constraints of the inputs before processing them.\n   - Type checking approach:\n     - Use isinstance() function in Python to check types.\n\n5. Performance requirements:\n   - Time complexity constraints:\n     - The solution should ideally run in O(n) time.\n   - Space complexity constraints:\n     - The space complexity should be O(n) as we are using a hash map to store n elements.\n   - Memory usage considerations:\n     - The memory usage should be minimized.\n   - Performance optimization opportunities:\n     - Use a single for loop to iterate the array, reducing the time complexity.\n\n6. Testing requirements:\n   - Critical test cases:\n     - Test with an array of two elements.\n     - Test with an array of more than two elements.\n   - Error scenarios to test:\n     - Test with invalid inputs.\n   - Edge cases to verify:\n     - Test with an array where all elements are the same.\n     - Test with an array where the two numbers are at the beginning and end of the array.\n   - Performance benchmarks needed:\n     - Test with an array of the maximum allowed length (10^4)."
