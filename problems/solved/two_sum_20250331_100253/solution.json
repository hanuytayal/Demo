    "description": "Implement a function called 'two_sum' that finds two numbers in an array that add up to a target value.\n\n1. Input:\n   - nums: A list of integers\n   - target: The target sum to find\n\n2. Output:\n   - Return a list of two indices [i, j] such that nums[i] + nums[j] = target\n   - You may assume that each input has exactly one solution\n   - You may not use the same element twice\n\n3. Constraints:\n   - 2 <= len(nums) <= 10^4\n   - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n   - -10^9 <= target <= 10^9\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9\nOutput: [0, 1]\nExplanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9\n\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6\nOutput: [1, 2]\nExplanation: nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [3, 3], target = 6\nOutput: [0, 1]\nExplanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 3 = 6",
    "analysis": "1. Problem requirements and constraints:\n   - Input parameters and their types: \n       - nums: List[int]: A list of integers.\n       - target: int: The target sum to find.\n   - Output format and type: List[int]: A list of two indices [i, j] such that nums[i] + nums[j] = target.\n   - Specific return type requirements: The returned list should contain exactly two indices from the input list.\n\n2. Key components and their relationships:\n   - The function should iterate through the list of integers, for each integer, it should check if there is another integer in the list such that their sum is equal to the target. \n   - The function should return the indices of these two integers.\n\n3. Error handling and validation requirements:\n   - Required input validation checks: The function should check if the input list contains at least 2 integers and does not exceed 10^4 integers.\n   - Type checking requirements: The input parameters should be of the correct types (List[int] for nums and int for target).\n   - Expected exceptions and error conditions: The function may raise an exception if the input parameters are of the wrong types or if the list does not contain at least two integers.\n   - Edge cases that must be handled: The function should correctly handle cases where the input list contains duplicate integers.\n   - Invalid input scenarios: The function should not accept lists that contain non-integer elements or targets that are not integers.\n   - Boundary conditions: The function should correctly handle cases where the integers in the input list or the target are at the lower or upper limits of the allowed range (-10^9 to 10^9).\n\n4. Implementation considerations:\n   - Suggested approach: One possible approach would be to use a dictionary to store the difference between the target and the current integer as the key and the index of the current integer as the value. This can allow the function to find the required pair of integers in a single pass through the input list.\n   - Required error handling: The function should include exception handling for type errors and invalid input sizes.\n   - Input validation strategy: The function should check the size and types of the input parameters before processing them.\n   - Type checking approach: The function can use the built-in isinstance function to check the types of the input parameters.\n   - Return type implementation details: The function should return a list of exactly two integers.\n\n5. Performance requirements:\n   - Time complexity constraints: The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input list.\n   - Space complexity constraints: The function should have a space complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input list.\n   - Memory usage considerations: The function should avoid unnecessary memory usage by not storing unnecessary data.\n   - Performance optimization opportunities: The function can be optimized by finding the required pair of integers in a single pass through the input list.\n\n6. Testing requirements:\n   - Critical test cases: The function should be tested with inputs that contain both positive and negative integers, as well as inputs that contain duplicate integers.\n   - Error scenarios to test: The function should be tested with invalid input parameters (wrong types or invalid sizes).\n   - Edge cases to verify: The function should be tested with inputs where the integers in the input list or the target are at the lower or upper limits of the allowed range.\n   - Performance benchmarks needed: The function should be benchmarked with large inputs to ensure it meets the performance requirements.\n   - Return type validation tests: The function should be tested to ensure it returns a list of exactly two integers."
